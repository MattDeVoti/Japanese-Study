/// off the edge; `LazyVGrid` wraps but forces every column to the same width,
/// which looks wrong for chips whose widths vary — a two-character word gets the
/// same box as a six-character one and the row turns into a gappy table.
///
/// Requires iOS 16 for the `Layout` protocol, which is the deployment target.
